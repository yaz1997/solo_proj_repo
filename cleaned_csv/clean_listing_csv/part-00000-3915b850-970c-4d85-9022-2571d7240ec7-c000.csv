8703026,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8703026,Comfortable Social-friendly Apt,The best thing is the great access to public transport. The T (Massachusetts Bay Transport Authority) can bring you to any part of the city and a station is less than a 5 minute walk from our place. The bed is a couch that converts to a comfy queen size bed with plenty of pillows sheets blankets and a few stuffed animals. Things to be upfront about: It's not a private room just a bed in our living room. Making our guests comfortable and at home is a priority a big part of how we've done that is by chatting and getting to know our guests we also both work so we keep pretty reasonable hours on sleeping and waking up so you'll have the space to your self when you need it. We're also two college age guys with (slightly) above average propensity for cleanliness but we're not perfect.

Keep in mind that this house is a sublet and I currently live here with my daughter thus my decor and belongings occupy the space. I will pack away clothing so that the dressers can be used. I am an avid gardner and the backyard has an organic veggie and herb garden to use. Feel free to eat what you like! The house is full of light plants and my eclectic decor.  I am an art professor and have a huge book collection feel free to read what you like but return the books before you leave. I treasure them.

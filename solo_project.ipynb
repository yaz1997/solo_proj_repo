Pair this with some fresh baked artisan bread that I bake and typically have on hand. If you love coffee and fresh home made bread it doesn't get any better then this. If you are interested I might give you a lesson or two on how to roast your own coffee. In addition to fresh baked bread toasted with jam additional breakfast offerings may include cereal bagels with cream cheese or on occassion a Colombian breakfast of arepa egg and cheese. It's delicioso and a high protein breakfast a great way to start the day. At the end of the day I occassionally offer a fresh baked baguette with a sampling of quality cheeses. Current coffee offerings are listed at the end of this description. This room offers a rare and unique unobstructed view of the Boston skyline that includes privacy.

All of my expectations for the stay were met, and I would highly recommend Evy to anyone looking to visit Boston.  The area is decent and with Uber I was able to get where I needed quickly.  Rosco was also great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

The guest space was impeccable and large. The bed was comfortable and it was great having a private bathroom. This was, without a doubt, better than staying in a hotel room! Evy was also super helpful in acquainting me with where to pick up the bus in the morning. Roscoe is also a very friendly and welcoming dog! Evy also left a couple bottles of her own cold-brewed tea - it was delicious and I was very impressed. One thing to note that I hadn't read in any of the other comments:  house rules are that you take off your shoes by the front door; you may want to bring slippers with you since the downstairs area is all bare floors.|\n",
